# stock-market-portfolio-optimisation
This project contains analysis of past one year data of top 4 stocks of nifty 50 and outputs the most optimised portfolio option for long term investment using Python.

**About** <br>
This project focuses on the optimization of a stock market portfolio using Python, leveraging historical stock data to make informed investment decisions. By employing Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), the project aims to construct an efficient portfolio that maximizes returns while minimizing risk. The analysis is conducted through a Jupyter Notebook, which provides a clear and interactive way to visualize the results and methodologies used.

**Description** <br>
In the realm of investing, constructing a well-diversified portfolio is crucial for achieving optimal returns. This project analyzes a selection of stocks, evaluates their historical performance, and applies statistical methods to determine the best combination of assets. The key objectives include:
1. Data Collection: Gathering historical stock price data using the yfinance library.
2. Data Analysis: Analyzing stock performance, calculating expected returns, and assessing risk through volatility.
3. Portfolio Optimization: Utilizing simulations to identify the optimal asset allocation that maximizes the Sharpe Ratio, which measures risk-adjusted return.
4. Visualization: Presenting the results through various plots, including the efficient frontier and individual stock performance.

**Features** <br>
1. Interactive Jupyter Notebook: The analysis and results are presented in a Jupyter Notebook format, allowing for easy exploration and modification.
2. Visualization of Results: Key insights are visualized through graphs and charts, making it easier to understand the relationship between risk and return.
3. Portfolio Recommendations: The project provides actionable recommendations for stock allocations based on the analysis.
